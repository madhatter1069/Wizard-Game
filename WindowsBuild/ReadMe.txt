Known Bugs:
	- Health pickups/system may become bugged and player may no longer be able to pick up health (Personally haven't seen it happen when players have low health so shouldn't be that much of a detriment)
	- If standing directly against a wall enemies may be able to hit players if they are also directly against the wall
	- Some of the boulder doors may slighty stick out from the wall and prevent players from moving smoothly against the wall (Players can still just walk around it though)
	- Player 2 can push Player 1 but Player 1 cannot push Player 2
		- This also leads to Player 1 sometimes being glitched into a wall if Player 2 pushes them, but they should just pop back out right away and shouldn't be a major issue
	

Feedback Requests:
	- Any suggestions for balancing the boss, as we recently implemented it
	- Any suggestions for balancing normal enemies
	- Would a single-player mode be fun or should it remain co-op only


Other Notes:
	- Boss room opens when all enemies in other rooms are defeated
	- The boss does not have any weakness, resistance, or immunity so any spell is usable
	- Boss has quite a lot of health and takes roughly 20 hits to kill it, but we've been able to personally defeated it solo so it is possible.
	- Boss is also able to walk through the obstacles, just not shoot through them (Not a bug)
	- When a player dies the surviving player should be teleported back to the starting room
